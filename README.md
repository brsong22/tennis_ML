# tennis_ML
goals:
-prepare data
-implement gradient descent
-predict length of finals match based on competitors (changed prediction goal from predicting winner to allow for better replication of examples and tutorials with non-classification oriented targets)
-future implementation with classification learning can attempt to predict first place finish based on player attributes

csv data files forked from JeffSackmann/tennis_atp
